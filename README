pcap2har: converts .pcap network capture files to HTTP Archive files.

Well, actually, it doesn't do that yet. This project is still under
construction. We will be slowly working up from parsing .pcap's, extracting
TCP flows from them, and interpreting those to generate a HAR file.

The HTTP Archive (HAR) file format specification is here:
http://groups.google.com/group/http-archive-specification/web/har-1-1-spec?hl=en
It is a fairly straightforward JSON format.

pcap2har is written in Python, and depends on the dpkt packet-parsing library
(http://code.google.com/p/dpkt/).
